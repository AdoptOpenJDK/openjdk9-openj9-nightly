# Nightly Builds

This repository was used for publishing all of the OpenJDK 9 with OpenJ9 nightly builds from the AdoptOpenJDK OpenJDK build community.
OpenJ9 is an enhanced JVM replacement for HotSpot (https://openjdk.java.net) (https://github.com/eclipse/openj9)

These binaries are built on a shared CI infrastructure (see https://ci.adoptopenjdk.net) using an openly shared build tool chain (see https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-build)

## WARNING: LATEST BINARIES ARE SOURCED FROM A DIFFERENT REPO
